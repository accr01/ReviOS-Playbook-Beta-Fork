ReviOS is a customized version of Windows, designed to be lightweight, stable, and focused on improving performance, privacy and compatibility. It aspires to re-create what Windows as an operating system should have been - easy and simple. Now compatible with [AME Wizard](https://ameliorated.io)🧙.

This is a forked repository of the original [ReviOS repository made by meetrevision](https://github.com/meetrevision/playbook), and we extend our gratitude to meetrevision for creating ReviOS. Meetrevision is the original owner of ReviOS.

This repository serves to maintain a release version with the latest code updates from the original ReviOS repository.

Please note that these versions are Beta and may contain errors and bugs. They are not supported by either me or the original creator of ReviOS.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🎯 Easy to use, just drag and drop the playbook into [AME Wizard](https://ameliorated.io)
- 🗑 Removes bloatware and unnecessary system components
- ⚡ Optimizes your system for performance and improved privacy
- 🔧 Integrates the [Revision Tool](https://github.com/meetrevision/revision-tool) to customize your system further
